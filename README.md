# Daily Habit Tracker

### Project Description

This is a personal project developed to learn Python and GUI implementation. The application provides a simple and quick way to track your daily habits and save the results to a text file for easy monitoring. I have made this for my habits but the code is modular and designed to be easily adapted for tracking different tasks or goals.

### Features

-   **Two Versions:** Includes both a terminal-based version and a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
-   **Standalone Executable:** The GUI version is packaged as a standalone `.exe` file for easy use on Windows without a Python installation.
-   **Data Persistence:** Saves daily logs to a text file, allowing you to track your habits over time.
-   **Clean UI:** A user-friendly interface designed for a quick and simple logging experience.

### Learning Goals

-   Python fundamentals
-   GUI development with `customtkinter`
-   File I/O and data persistence
-   Cross-platform deployment with `PyInstaller`
